| run              | Start docker locally and expose docker volume `/opt/payara/payara5/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy` to directory `./artifact` so that every time `mvn package` is run locally it will automatically redeploy the application in the docker environment |

# Docker

- The docker image is hosted:
  - [ivonet/payara](http://ivo2u.nl/tM) / [GitHub](http://ivo2u.nl/oO)
  - [ivonet/glassfish](http://ivo2u.nl/tP) / [GitHub](http://ivo2u.nl/Vu)


```shell
docker build -t DOCKER_HANDLE/IMAGE_NAME .
docker push DOCKER_HANDLE/IMAGE_NAME
```

Make sure to replace DOCKER_HANDLE/IMAGE_NAME with actual values.

# Example endpoint

- [http://localhost:8080/ClientApplication/rest/example](http://localhost:8080/ClientApplication/rest/example)
- [health check url](http://localhost:8080/health)

# Drop in replacement

The payara/server-full docker image en the ivonet/payara images are almost drop-in
replacements of each other.

One of the main reasons the ivonet/payara image is used is that I as the maker have control
over the java version I want to use and I can create a multi-platform build. 

At the time this archetype was published there was only an amd64 build of te official payara 
docker image.
